## üßê About <a id = "about"></a>

I created this project as a digital journal, inspired by the need for a versatile and organized way to manage schedules, grades, and communication with teachers. It's a practical solution to real-world challenges faced by students, allowing for efficient tracking of lessons, assignments, and attendance.

During the development process, I collaborated with my programming teacher to plan the functionalities of the digital journal, drawing inspiration from a similar electronic journal used in my college.

This project addresses a common need in education, providing students, directors, and teachers with a comprehensive tool for managing their academic responsibilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack <a id = "tech_stack"></a>

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [MySQL database](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Laravel Reverb](https://reverb.laravel.com/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requiremenets <a id = "requirements"></a>

Server requirements to run locally:
- PHP >= 8.2
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (LTS)
- MySQL 8.0

To run on Docker:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## üöÄ Running the Program <a id = "running"></a>

To run the program locally, simply clone the repository and execute the start script:
```
git clone https://github.com/dmisl/Dynamitowy.git
cd <project_directory>
php start.php
```
This script automates all necessary setup steps, including installing PHP/JS dependencies, setting up environment variables, running migrations, starting the development server, and launching the WebSocket server (Laravel Reverb).

Once the script completes, your program will be up and running, ready for you to use.

---

To run the program using Docker:

Before running Docker commands, update the .env file with your database configuration.

```
DB_HOST=database
DB_USERNAME=someone
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```
then run
```
php start.php
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

This will set up the program environment using Docker, allowing you to run it seamlessly. (If you encounter any issues with the environment run `docker-compose down` then `docker-compose up`)
